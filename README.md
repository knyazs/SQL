# Intro

SQL project contains code samples I built for different purposes that could benefit others.

## cron_expander.sql

The [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) command-line utility, also known as cron job, is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems.

The code sample implements cron expander functionality using pure T-SQL codeand  calculates previous and next value for a given set of crons.
